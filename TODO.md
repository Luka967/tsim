- [ ] Move control points while holding `Ctrl`
- [ ] Delete road lanes while holding `Alt`
- [ ] Group road lanes into road
 - [ ] Draw lane markings for road lanes that are parallel and close enough
- [ ] UI skeleton
- [ ] Remove hotkey-based controls
- [ ] Select action with buttons:
 - [ ] Make road lane - width, type
 - [ ] Group road lanes
 - [ ] Make road configuration - make multiple, parallel road lanes with same curve
 - [ ] Delete road lane
- Grouped roads end in half-circle U-turns
- [ ] Select curve type with buttons:
 - [ ] Straight - 2 clicks make straight
 - [ ] Simple curve - 3 clicks make quadratic bezier's points
 - [ ] Complex curve - 4 clicks make cubic bezier's points
 - [ ] C:S's Freeform - quadratic curve, match distance between start-control and control-end points
- [ ] Toggle snapping with buttons:
 - [ ] Snap to grid
 - [ ] Parallel to existing road lane
  - [ ] Always follow existing road lane's curve
 - [ ] Normal to road lane
- [ ] Curve information when drawing
 - [ ] Length
 - [ ] Angle when applicable
- [ ] Follow guide snapping
 - [ ] Curve derivative
 - [ ] Draw possible follow guides, select which ones to include in snapping
 - [ ] Implement the following
- [ ] Intersection creation
 - [ ] Detect which curves are intersecting
 - [ ] Create intersection button
 - [ ] Splice existing curves to not intersect each other at all anymore
 - [ ] Automatically generate curves
 - [ ] Adjustable offsets to each intersection side
 - [ ] Turn road markings
 - [ ] Crosswalks?

Broad ideas:
- [ ] Represent all that shit within the road lane graph
- [ ] Traffic lights
- [ ] Figure out how to represent t-value in fixed distances to use in vehicle road lane following
- [ ] Vehicle spawning, following road lanes
- [ ] AABB quadtree representation of vehicles in traffic
- [ ] Vehicle stops when there is traffic ahead
- [ ] Vehicle decelerates when there is traffic ahead

Possible optimizations:
- [ ] AABB quadtree with bounding boxes of curves to use in snapping lookup
- [ ] Dynamically buily point and/or raycast (???) quadtree to use in snap to follow guide lookup
