# tsim

My bruteforce attempt at learning more about analytical geometry past stupid ass circles and trying to create a traffic simulation at the same time

Watch me churn out (or not even bother doing) tasks in TODO.md every now and then

I'm doing this in TypeScript because I don't know better anymore, and fuck Unity lol
